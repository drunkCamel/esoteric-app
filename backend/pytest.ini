# A configuration file for pytest, that would tell pytest how to behave when test are running. 
# It specifies the test paths, file patterns, and additional options for running tests and generating coverage reports.
# Instead of typing long list of options every time we would just run 'pytest' and it would automatically pick up these settings from this file.
